  <h2>Question 1: What is Modifield Harvard Architecture?</h2>
  <p>a. The architecture addresses the issues faced by the two previous architectures by storing both data and instructions in a single memory unit while still separating two channels for data and instructions.</p>
  <p>b. The Modifield Harvard architecture was the first to be created and served as inspiration for the architectures that came before it.</p>
  <p>c. Modifying the Harvard architecture is essentially the same as the Harvard architecture itself.</p>
  <p>d. Creating a more complex Harvard architecture by adding more memory units.</p>
